<p style="color:blue;">Hello everyone! Welcome to my Github account. I'm from Argentina, at the moment I find myself studying on a digital education platform called Coserhouse, their Python course, with Django as framework to develop a Website with it. This course includes the introduction to POO (Object Orientation Programing) plus communication with a SQLite database.

The achievements I would like to accomplish on short term are: to learn about SQL, FastAPI, HTML and CSS to make a robust E-commerce. Also trying the development of my frontend learning by myself.

I speak the languages of english, spanish which is my first language, plus a little bit of portugues.

Hope to make some friends on this world of programing and develop new skills on the long term!</p>
